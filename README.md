# Geographical Data Analysis

# Geographical Data Analysis of Student’s distance form campus on Excel

There are two components for this project:

●	A PowerPoint presentation explaining the project named 'GIS_analysis_ppt'

Chart 1:  Created a combination bar and line graph that displays:
•	X-Axis:  Distance from campus in 20-mile increments up to 300 miles
•	Bars:  Share of all students
•	Lines:  Cumulative share of all students, and share of students from each campus (5 lines total)
•	Problem Statement:  What mile radius would be required to capture at least 80% of each campus’ respective student population?

Chart 2:  Created a table that displays:
•	Column 1:  Distance from campus in 20-mile increments up to 300 miles, and one line for >300 miles
•	Columns:  Share of students attending each campus within distance range indicated (4 columns total)

●	An excel workbook named 'Clean_analysis' which cleanly displaying all manipulations of the data used to create the PowerPoint presentation

There is an excel file named 'Raw_data_sheet' which consists of raw data to begin with

I utilized PivotTables to summarize and analyze large datasets efficiently, allowing me to dynamically explore trends and insights. To standardize and structure the data, I implemented VLOOKUPs to fetch relevant information from different sheets and datasets, ensuring consistency and eliminating redundancies. Additionally, I applied IF statements to handle conditional logic, such as categorizing data based on predefined criteria or flagging discrepancies for data validation.

Furthermore, I performed cumulative additions to track running totals over time, which helped in trend analysis. I also calculated percentages to derive meaningful comparisons and insights, such as contribution analysis or growth rates. By combining all these techniques, I structured the cleaned and processed data into a consolidated workbook, making it easy to analyze and visualize.

Finally, I leveraged the refined dataset to create multiple charts and visualizations, utilizing dual-axis charts where necessary to represent complex relationships effectively. This approach enabled a clearer understanding of key metrics and trends, ultimately helping to address the problem statement with a data-driven solution.


Assumptions that I addressed in the PowerPoint Presentation:
•	How did we determine online student distances?
•	How did we handle students without a GEOID?
