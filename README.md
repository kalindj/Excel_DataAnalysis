# Geographical Data Analysis

# Geographical Data Analysis of Student’s distance form campus on Excel

There are two components for this project:

●	A PowerPoint presentation explaining the project named 'GIS_analysis_ppt'

Chart 1:  Created a combination bar and line graph that displays:
•	X-Axis:  Distance from campus in 20-mile increments up to 300 miles
•	Bars:  Share of all students
•	Lines:  Cumulative share of all students, and share of students from each campus (5 lines total)
•	Problem Statement:  What mile radius would be required to capture at least 80% of each campus’ respective student population?

Chart 2:  Created a table that displays:
•	Column 1:  Distance from campus in 20-mile increments up to 300 miles, and one line for >300 miles
•	Columns:  Share of students attending each campus within distance range indicated (4 columns total)

●	An excel workbook named 'GIS_analysis' which cleanly displaying all manipulations of the data used to create the PowerPoint presentation


Assumptions that I addressed in PowerPoint Presentation:
•	How did we determine online student distances?
•	How did we handle students without a GEOID?
